The laboratory work for this thesis and the writing was conducted by me with the partial exception of chapter \ref{BF-form} (see below). 
The abstract was proofread by Dr. Bernard Lepetit. The chapters *\nameref{gI}* and *\nameref{CRP-chapter}* were proofread by Lili Chu and Dr. Ansgar Gruber, respectively, as well as by Prof. Peter G. Kroth. 
Kai-Uwe Eckhardt provided the supplemental Py-FIMS information. 
Individual contributions to the chapters are listed below.
